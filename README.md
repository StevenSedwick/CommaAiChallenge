# CommaAiChallenge
My take on the Comma.ai challenge! This was a test given to me by a mentor to see if I could work with him. I passed!

I was able to get a 9.0 on this attempt. I will be adding more TODOs to this as I go. Currently my plan is to find a way to have the model detect zero movement or deacceleration with more accuracy.

I can't give enough thanks to Ryan Chesler and his collection of other repositories. The scientific endeavor and the community that grew from this challenge was immense! It was cool to look back a few years ago and see what people accomplished!
